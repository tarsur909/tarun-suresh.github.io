## About Me

I'm Tarun Suresh, a third-year undergraduate student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign advised by Prof. [Sasa Misailovic](https://misailo.cs.illinois.edu/), Prof. [Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io/), and Prof. Heng Ji.


I am deeply interested in the intersection of deep learning, systems, and formal methods/programming languages. My research goal is to develop principled techniques that enhance the effectiveness, scalability, and reliability of AI systems, particularly in software development and safety-critical domains.


## Research Interests

- **Structured Output Generation with Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- **Embedding Models, Re-Ranking, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation**
- **AI for Code (ie Code Generation, Bug Finding)**
- **AI Reasoning (Math, Formal Logic)**
- **Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning (PBRL) (.ie  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF))**
- **AI Safety (Formal Verification, Robustness)**
